/*
 * Problem statement:
 * Given an m x n 2D binary grid which represents a map of 1s (land) and 0s (water), return the number of islands.

An island is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water.

 

Example 1:

Input: grid = [           (x,y) -> (0,0) -> 1   (1,3) -> (1,2), (1,4),(0,3), (2,3)  (i,j-1),(i,j+1),(i-1,j),(i+1,j)   -> (i,j+1),(i+1,j)
  [1, 1, 1, 1, 0],
  [1, 1, 0, 1, 0],
  [1, 1, 0, 0, 0],
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
]
Output: 1

Example 2:

Input: grid = [
  [1, 1, 0, 0, 0],
  [1, 1, 1, 1, 0],
  [0, 1, 1, 0, 0],
  [0, 0, 0, 1, 1]
]
Output: 3

[
0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 1, 0
0, 1, 1, 0
0, 0, 0, 0
]
